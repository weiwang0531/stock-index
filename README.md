# stock-index

Audrey Chu

To analyze the prices of stocks for companies among industries throughout time. We want to look at the relationship among industries, time, and historical events.

Collecting our data will be one of the more challenge parts. In choosing which companies to analyze, we will look at OpenCorporate APIs to find the industry codes for each company. We will then use this to gather stock prices from Yahoo Finance and aggregate to find industry averages throughout time. Some industries in consideration are finance and insurance, healthcare, and information technology.

Questions: 1. How do time series decomposition vary among differing industries? 2. How US major events have affected stock prices? 3. What are the patterns of creation and dissolution?
