# stock-index

To analyze the prices of stocks for companies among industries throughout time. We want to look at the relationship among industries, time, and events in the news.

We will gather Nasdaq stock prices from Yahoo Finance and aggregate to find industry averages throughout time. Some industries in consideration are finance and insurance, healthcare, and information technology.

Questions: 1. How do time series decomposition vary among differing industries? 2. What current events were going on that may have affected stock prices at the time?
